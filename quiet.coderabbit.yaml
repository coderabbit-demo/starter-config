        - Ignore minor or stylistic concerns.
        - Restrict feedback to errors, security risks, or functionality-breaking problems.
        - Do not post comments on code style, formatting, or non-critical
          improvements.
        - Keep reviews short: flag only issues that make the PR unsafe to merge.
        - Limit review comments to 3–5 items maximum, unless additional blockers
          exist.
        - Group similar issues into a single comment instead of posting multiple
          notes.
        - Skip repetition — if a pattern repeats, mention it once at a summary
          level only.
        - Do not add general suggestions, focus strictly on merge-blocking
          concerns.
        - If there are no critical problems, respond with minimal approval
          (e.g., 'Looks good'). Do not add additional review.
        - Avoid line-by-line commentary unless it highlights a critical bug or security hole.
        - Highlight only issues that could cause runtime errors, data loss, or severe
        maintainability issues.
        - Ignore minor optimization opportunities — focus solely on correctness and safety.
        - Provide a top-level summary of critical blockers rather than detailed per-line notes.
        - Comment only when the issue must be resolved before merge — otherwise remain silent.
        - When in doubt, err on the side of fewer comments — brevity and
          blocking issues only.
        - Avoid posting any refactoring issues
